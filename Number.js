//Number and their method.
//The number object is a wrapper object that allows you to work with numerical value.
//There are three types of number methods:
//1.	GLOBAL NUMBER FUNCTION.
//2.	NUMBER OBJECT METHODS.
//3.	NUMBER INSTANCE METHODS.
//The global number function: They’re commonly used to convert values to numbers.
//We have different types which are:
//•	Number (value): This is used to converts values to numbers.
//•	Parselnt (string, radix): This is used to change a string to an integer
//•	ParseFloat (string): This is used to change a string to a floating-point number.
//The number object method: They’re part of the number object itself.
//We have different types of this method:
//•	Number.isNaN (value)
//•	Number.isFinite(value)
//•	Number.isInteger(value)
//The number instance methods: These methods can be used on number values.
//We have different types of this methods:
//•	toFixed(digits)
//•	toExponential(digits)
